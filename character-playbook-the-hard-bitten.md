- You find it hard to trust people but __________ is the one person with whom you would trust your life. You’re sure they will never let you down.
- __________ and you were once romantically involved.  Agree with each other why it didn’t work.
- You were supposed to kill __________ but you didn’t. Why not? And why were you going to kill them?
- You and __________ are close relations. Agree with them exactly how you’re related.
- __________ is one of the few people you are genuinely scared of. Tell them why.
- You have a soft spot for __________, because they remind you of your younger self. Tell them.

### Pick three moves
- [ ] __Remember Your Training__. You roll with +1 to __Act Under Pressure__.
- [ ] __Combat Hardened__. You have +1 _Armour_ in addition to whatever armour you're wearing.
- [ ] __No Time To Bleed__. You may ignore up to 3 points of injury through sheer bloody-mindedness. However, for every point of injury ignored in this way, the GM may deduct 1 from any of your rolls they choose, until all such points are spent.
