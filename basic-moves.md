# Basic Moves That Everyone Can Do

Aboard your ship, when someone is injured and you Get Them To Medbay! roll *+Sharp* to see how many injuries they recover from every 24 hours. 
* On a 10+ they recover from three injuries.
* On a 7-9 they recover from two injuries.
* On a miss, they recover one injury.  

Once a patient is in Medbay, you cannot use Patch Someone Up on them.

When you Resort To Violence, roll *+Tough*:
- On any success (7+), you inflict harm on (and suffer harm from) whatever you’re fighting. This usually means you inflict the harm rating of your weapon and your enemies inflict their attack’s harm rating on you. 
-  On a 10+, choose one extra effect:
  - You gain the advantage: take +1 forward
  - Give +1 forward to another character. 
  - You inflict terrible harm (+1 harm). 
  - You suffer less harm (-1 harm). 
  - You force them where you want them. 
- On a miss, you suffer harm or get captured, but don’t inflict any harm back.  

This result of this move reflects a short series of back-and-forth attacks by the character and their opponent(s). It doesn’t represent a single attack, nor an entire combat in one roll.

When you Lend A Hand to someone attempting something challenging, describe how you help and roll +(whatever the person you’re helping is rolling).  
E.g. if you’re helping a person rolling *+Tough*, you will roll *+Tough* also.
- On a 10+, you give them +1 to their roll.
- On a 7-9, you give them +1 to their roll, but you expose yourself to danger.
- On a miss, you expose yourself to danger without helping.

When you use a medkit to Patch Someone Up in or shortly after combat, roll *+Cool*:
- On a 10+, they recover from two injuries. 
- On a 7-9, they recover from one injury, or two if you expose yourself to danger. Your choice.
- On a miss, you inflict one further wound on them.  

Only one attempt to Patch Someone Up can be made on a patient until they have been fully healed.

When you Activate Scanners (personal or ship) to survey somewhere, roll *+Sharp*.  
The GM must answer questions honestly and, unless stated otherwise, reasonably directly, but not necessarily in full!
- On a 10+, ask two questions from this list:
  - Where are my fellow crew members? 
  - What life forms are in range? 
  - What do I know about this place? 
  - What’s wrong here? 
  - What’s useful here? 
  - How long do we have?
- On a 7-9, ask one question from the list.
- On a miss, ask one question from the list, but the GM can answer as cryptically or vaguely as they choose

When you __Lean On Someone__ in an effort to make them do what you want, describe your approach If the GM thinks it’s reasonable/possible that your target might be persuaded, roll *+Charm*:
- On a 10+, they do what you want.
- On a 7-9, they’ll do what you want, but only if you do something for them first.
- On a miss, they refuse and are offended or enraged that you would even ask.

When you Try To Protect Someone, roll *+Tough*:
- On any success (7+), you protect them okay, but you’ll suffer some or all of the harm they were going to get.
- On a 10+, choose an extra: You suffer 1 less harm. All enemies are now focused on you. You inflict harm on the enemy. You hold the enemy back.
- On a miss, then you end up making things worse.

When you __Invoke “Handwavium”__ to explain how the impossible might be possible, if our understanding of science is wrong, explain it to the group. Use as much technobabble as possible, and then roll *+Anomalous*:
- On a 10+, it works! Choose an effect from the list below.
- On a 7-9, it works, but there’s a glitch. Choose an effect and the GM will choose/invent a glitch.
- On a miss, it goes horribly and spectacularly wrong.
