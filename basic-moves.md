# Basic Moves That Everyone Can Do

When you __Act Under Pressure__, roll *+Cool*:
- On a 10+ you do what you set out to.
- On a 7-9 the Keeper is going to give you a worse outcome, a hard choice, a or price to pay. 
- On a miss, things go to hell.

This move is basically a catch-all move for when a character attempts something risky that's not covered by any of the other moves.

When someone is injured and you __Get Them To Medbay__ aboard your ship roll *+Cool* to see how quickly you got them there, and thus how many injuries they recover from every 24 hours. 
* On a 10+ they recover from three injuries.
* On a 7-9 they recover from two injuries.
* On a miss, they recover one injury.  

Once a patient is in Medbay, you cannot use __Patch Someone Up__ on them.

When you __Resort To Violence__, roll *+Tough*:
- On any success (7+), you inflict harm on (and suffer harm from) whatever you’re fighting. This usually means you inflict the harm rating of your weapon and your enemies inflict their attack’s harm rating on you.
- On a 10+, choose one extra effect:
  - You gain the advantage: take +1 forward
  - Give +1 forward to another character. 
  - You inflict terrible harm (+1 harm). 
  - You suffer less harm (-1 harm). 
  - You force them where you want them. 
- On a miss, you suffer harm or get captured, but don’t inflict any harm back.  

This result of this move reflects a short series of back-and-forth attacks by the character and their opponent(s). It doesn’t represent a single attack, nor an entire combat in one roll.

When you __Lend A Hand__ to someone attempting something challenging, describe how you help and roll +(whatever the person you’re helping is rolling).  
E.g. if you’re helping a person rolling *+Tough*, you will roll *+Tough* also.
- On a 10+, you give them +1 to their roll.
- On a 7-9, you give them +1 to their roll, but you expose yourself to danger.
- On a miss, you expose yourself to danger without helping.

---

When you use a medkit to __Patch Someone Up__ in or shortly after combat, roll *+Cool*:
- On a 10+, they recover from two injuries. 
- On a 7-9, they recover from one injury, or two if you expose yourself to danger. Your choice.
- On a miss, you bungle it badly and inflict one further wound on them.  

Only one attempt to Patch Someone Up can be made on a patient until they have been fully healed.

---

When you __Activate Scanners__ (personal or ship) to survey somewhere, roll *+Sharp*.  
The GM must answer questions honestly and, unless stated otherwise, reasonably directly, but not necessarily in full!
- On a 10+, ask two questions from this list:
  - Where are my fellow crew members? 
  - What life forms are in range? 
  - What do I know about this place? 
  - What’s wrong here? 
  - What’s useful here? 
  - How long do we have?
- On a 7-9, ask one question from the list.
- On a miss, ask one question from the list, but the GM can answer as cryptically or vaguely as they choose


---

When you __Lean On Someone__ in an effort to make them do what you want, describe your approach. If the GM thinks it’s reasonable/possible that your target might be persuaded, roll *+Charm*:
- On a 10+, they do what you want.
- On a 7-9, they’ll do what you want, but only if you do something for them first.
- On a miss, they refuse and are offended or enraged that you would even ask.

---

When you __Try To Protect Someone__, roll *+Tough*:
- On any success (7+), you protect them okay, but you’ll suffer some or all of the harm they were going to get.
- On a 10+, choose an extra: 
  - You suffer 1 less harm. 
  - All enemies are now focused on you. 
  - You inflict harm on the enemy. (Usually your weapon damage, but it depends on the situation)
  - You hold the enemy back.
- On a miss, then you end up making things worse.

---

Once per session you may __Invoke “Handwavium”__ to explain how the seemingly impossible might be possible, with the application of some truly advanced super-science. Explain it to the group using as much technobabble as possible, and then roll *+Anomalous*:
- On a 10+, it works! Choose an effect from this list:
  - TODO
  - TODO
  - TODO
  - TODO
- On a 7-9, it works, but there’s a glitch. Choose an effect from the list and the GM will invent a glitch or choose one from this list:
  - TODO
  - TODO
  - TODO
- On a miss, it goes horribly and spectacularly wrong.
