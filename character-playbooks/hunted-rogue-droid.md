# Rogue Droid

Mmaybe you're newly-sentient, through a glitch or an experiment, and slowly learning how to be a Good Person. At least how to not freak everyone out.  
Perhaps the authorities accused you of going beserk and killing someone. Perhaps they're right?  

### Name:  
### Pronouns:  
### Appearance:  
### Pick a relationship between you and at least one other character:
- ___________ risked everything to help you escape. Agree with them why they did it.
- ___________ had a perfect opportunity to claim the bounty on your head, but they didn't. Agree with them why not.
- ___________ abandoned you when your recapture was imminent. Agree with them what happened and how you escaped.
- You knew ___________ back before your troubles began. How did you know them?
- ___________ is the first person to make you laugh since you went on the run. Tell/ask them what they did to cheer you up.
- You aren't sure you can trust ___________. Tell them why.
- Shortly after joining this crew, you stole and used ___________'s ID for news/archive access, meaning they may now be a Person Of Interest to your pursuers.  Confess this to them now, and explain your suspicions.
- ___________ was one of/working with your captors before you escaped. Did they help you escape? Do they even recognise you?

### Pick Three Moves:
- [ ] __Desperate Plan__. When you... 
- [ ] __Showtime!__. You surprise everyone with a display of exactly why the authorities are hunting you. Roll _+anomalous_: On a 10+, you
