### Pick a relationship between you and at least one other character:
- ___________ Saved you from a sticky situation. Tell them what happened. 
- ___________ provided you with a vital piece of kit for your workshop/laboratory.  Tell them what it was and ask where they got it from.
- You and ___________ are old friends from college.
- You invented the device/vaccine/process that saved ___________‘s life. Tell them about it.
- ___________ was sent to “deal with” you and the threat posed by your research, but they didn’t go through with it. Tell/ask them why they changed their mind and let you live.
- You and ___________ were nearly romantically involved once. Agree with them why it would never work between you.

### Pick three moves:
When you use a medkit to __Patch Someone Up__ in or after combat, you may roll *+Sharp* instead of *+Cool*:
- On a 10+ they recover from 3 injuries. 
- On a 7-9 they recover from 2 injuries.
- On a miss, they recover nothing but are stabilised and will not die from their wounds.  

Only one attempt to Patch Someone Up can be made on a patient until they are fully healed.

When you **Get Them To Medbay!** aboard your ship, you may roll *+Sharp* instead of *+Cool*, and add +1 to your roll. 

---

When you __Activate Scanners__ (personal or ship) to survey somewhere, roll *+Sharp* and add +1.

---

When you __Take It Into The Lab__ aboard ship to study something, roll *+Sharp*:  
The GM must answer questions honestly and, unless stated otherwise, reasonably directly, but not necessarily in full.  
- On a 10+, ask two questions from this list:
  - What is the purpose of this? 
  - How dangerous is it? 
  - How can I activate it? 
  - How can I deactivate/destroy/counter it? 
  - How can I duplicate/recreate it?
- On a 7-9, ask one question from the list.
- On a miss, ask one question from the list, but the GM can answer as cryptically or vaguely as they choose.

When you __Jury-Rig Something__ to either create or fix it, roll *+Sharp*:  
- On a 10+, it works like a charm. If undamaged, it will last as long as you need it to.
- On a 7-9 it will work until the end of the current scene, or requires you to actively hold it together/in place. You choice.
- On a miss, it fails and breaks one of its key components.

When you __Use Handwavium__ to explain how the impossible might be possible if our understanding of science is wrong, roll __+Anomalous__:
