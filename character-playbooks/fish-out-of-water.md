- You have formed a sacred bond with ___________ that you can't easily explain to them. Try to convey to them, without using words, what it means to you.
- ___________ scares you more than any of the others. Discuss with them why that is.
- ___________ is the one member of your crew who you simply don't understand. Give them an example of something they did that still puzzles you to this day.
