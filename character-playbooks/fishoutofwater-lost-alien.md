# The Lost Alien

You're very much Not From Around Here. Even in a society that has subsumed countless other alien species, you stand out.  
How did you even get here? What do you miss about your home planet?  

### Name:  
### Pronouns:  
### Appearance:  
### Pick a relationship between you and at least one other character:
- ___________ is who you turn to for advice on what's "normal" or acceptable, and to explain situations you don't understand. Give them an example of something they explained to you recently.
- You have formed a sacred bond with ___________ that you can't easily explain to them. Try to convey to them, without using words, what it means to you.
- ___________ scares you more than any of the others. Discuss with them why that is.
- ___________ is the one member of your crew who you simply don't understand. Give them an example of something they did that still puzzles you to this day.
- You look up to ___________ as a role model. One day you want to be like them. Tell them why.
- You are starting to fall for ___________ romantically but are struggling to process it. Agree with their player whether that's OK, and how both your characters are handling it. I.e. Are they even aware? Do the two of you have a future? 
- ___________ has promised to get you home. Somehow. Ask them to renew that promise now.
- You are/were being hunted by Conglomerate Forces, but ___________ took you aboard this ship and whisked you to comparative safety. Ask them what happened and why they did it.
