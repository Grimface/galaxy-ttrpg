Pick 3 moves:
When you use a medkit to Patch Someone Up in or after combat, you may roll +Sharp instead of +Cool:
* On a 10+ they recover from 3 injuries. 
* On a 7-9 they recover from 2 injuries.
* On a miss, they recover nothing but are stabilised and will not die from their wounds.
* Only one attempt to Patch Someone Up can be made on a patient until they are fully healed.


When you Get Them To Medbay! aboard your ship, you may roll +Sharp instead of +Cool, and add +1 to your roll. 


When you Activate Scanners (personal or ship) to survey somewhere, roll +Sharp and add +1.


Aboard ship, when you Take It Into The Lab to study something, roll +Sharp. 
The GM must answer questions honestly and, unless stated otherwise, reasonably directly, but not necessarily in full.
* On a 10+, ask two questions from the list below.
* On a 7-9, ask one question from the list.
* On a miss, ask one question from the list, but the GM can answer as cryptically or vaguely as they choose.
What is the purpose of this? How dangerous is it? How can I activate it? How can I deactivate/destroy/counter it? How can I duplicate/recreate it?


When you Jury-Rig Something to either create or fix it, roll +Sharp.
* On a 10+, it works like a charm. If undamaged, it will last as long as you need it to.
* On a 7-9 it will work until the end of the current scene, or requires you to actively hold it together/in place. You choice.
* On a miss, it fails and breaks one of its key components.
