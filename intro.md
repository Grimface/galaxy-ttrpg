The year is 5032. For over two thousand years, humanity has been heading out into the unknown, jump drives taking us vast distances in weeks rather than aeons. 
Waves of colonists, explorers, cults and armies have rippled out across our arm of the galaxy. Ebbing and flowing as empires rose and fell. Star systems colonised and then abandoned to fend for themselves for centuries or more.
Along the way, we discovered we weren’t alone in the universe. Some aliens welcomed us like parents greeting long-lost children. Some shunned us and others attacked on sight. A few disappeared mysteriously, long before we arrived, leaving only their puzzling monuments and technological wonders. 
Right now, known space is in the grip of The Conglomerate.  A patchwork of commercial fiefdoms, cheerfully efficient on the surface but brutally corrupt underneath, it has ruled for the last six hundred years. Its influence is weakest at the edges, which is why people like you gravitate here. 
Here you hoped you’d breathe easier.  You fell in with a motley crew of like-minded people and together you made some hard decisions. These left you with a huge debt to pay off, but a ship of your own and a galaxy waiting to be explored, free from Tyranny.
But can you outrun your past?
