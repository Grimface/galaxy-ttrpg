# Running the game

Much like the countdown in _Monster of the Week_, every adventure should have distinct phases, to represent what would happen if the characters didn't intervene.
Rather than having 6 or so stages, I think 3 or 4 should be sufficient:
1. How we got here. This is the setup of the adventure, detailing what happened before the PCs arrived.
2. What's happening now.
3. How it gets worse.
4. How it ends.

For example:
1. An armed paramilitary group have taken hostages in an orbital refuelling station above the planet Espil-III, for political reasons.
2. The PCs arrive as news of this breaks, and the group's demands are broadcast.
3. The planetary government sends special forces hidden among a party of negotiators, up to the oribital platform.
4. Special forces kill the paramilitary members, but not before all hostages are also killed. Unclear if the Special Forces even tried to prevent this. OR the paramilitary group kill the hostages anyway, when the govt refuses to accede to their demands.

The PCs won't necessarily know what's happening at each stage, but should be able to find enough clues to predict what will likely happen next, and maybe get a chance to stop it. The PCs might deal with the situation before step #4. They might even be able to prevent #3 from happening.
