So, for the character playbooks, should they be "Few broad themes, with background options" or "Each background option + theme as it's own playbook"?

I want playbooks to stand alone, a-la Monster Of The Week and Dungeon World. Not have a complicated Traveller-style character creation process like Uncharted Worlds or Impulse Drive.

What individual playbooks might there be, if I were to cover off all the popular TV/Movie characters I can think of?

- Cocky smuggler (Malcom Reynolds from Firefly/Han Solo from Star Wars)
- Science officer (Bones, Spock, Uhura, Beverly Crusher, Miles O'Brien from Star Trek/Professor Bergman from Space 1999)
- Overworked engineer (Kaylee Frye from Firefly/Scotty from Star Trek)
- Bounty hunter (The Mandalorian, Boba Fett)
- Mysterious hermit (Obi Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in the later Star Wars films/The Vorlon ambassador from Babylon 5)
- Enigmatic alien (Delenn from Babylon 5?/Spock, Deanna Troi, Odo from Star Trek/Yoda, Baby Yoda from Star Wars/Maya from Space 1999/Hawk from Buck Rogers)
- Disgraced priest (Book from Firefly)
- Ace pilot (Mal, Wash from Firefly/Luke or Han from Star Wars/Buck Rogers)
- Noble/politician who Gets Shit Done (Leia Organa from Star Wars/Wilma Deering from Buck Rogers?/All the Star Trek captains)
- Escaped lab subject (River Tam from Firefly/Takeshi Kovacs from Altered Carbon, kinda)
- Bruiser/Gun Nut (Jayne Cobb from Firefly/Worf from Star Trek)
- Droid/Android (R2D2, C3P0, BB8 from Star Wars/Data from Star Trek/Marvin from HHGTTG/Tweakie from Buck Rogers)
- Time-displaced Action Hero (Buck Rogers/Whatisname from Altered Carbon)
- Bio-engineered Super-soldier (Takeshi Kovacs)

Could the Enigmatic Alien and the Mysterious Hermit be rolled into 1? I suspect they'll both have very similar moves.

Whilst Takeshi Kovacs is more Cyberpunk than hard scifi in book 1, book 2 is pure scifi. However, I suspect he can be rolled up into the escaped lab subject.
