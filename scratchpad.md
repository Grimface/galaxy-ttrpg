So, for the character playbooks, should they be "Few broad themes, with background options" or "Each background option + theme as it's own playbook"?

I want playbooks to stand alone, a-la Monster Of The Week and Dungeon World. Not have a complicated Traveller-style character creation process like Uncharted Worlds or Impulse Drive.  

With that in mind, I think my options are
- Lean into existing archetypes from TV/movies
- Make the playbooks fairly dry things like "Security", "Science", "Engineering" (i.e. close to Star Trek archetypes)
- Create my own, as I was originally doing. (The Fallen, etc.)

I like the idea of the TV/Movie archetypes, as people will be able to identify with them a bit more easily I think. Especially for a 1-shot kind of game. I think people want familiar things to latch onto in 1-shots, as they don't have much time to develop a nuanced character background etc.

What individual playbooks might there be, if I were to cover off all the popular TV/Movie characters I can think of?

- Cocky smuggler (Malcom Reynolds from Firefly/Han Solo from Star Wars)
- Science officer (Bones, Spock, Uhura, Beverly Crusher, Miles O'Brien from Star Trek/Professor Bergman from Space 1999)
- Overworked engineer (Kaylee Frye from Firefly/Scotty from Star Trek)
- Bounty hunter (The Mandalorian, Boba Fett)
- Mysterious hermit (Obi Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in the later Star Wars films/The Vorlon ambassador from Babylon 5)
- Enigmatic alien (Delenn from Babylon 5?/Spock, Deanna Troi, Odo from Star Trek/Yoda, Baby Yoda from Star Wars/Maya from Space 1999/Hawk from Buck Rogers)
- Disgraced priest (Book from Firefly)
- Ace pilot (Mal, Wash from Firefly/Luke or Han from Star Wars/Buck Rogers)
- Noble/politician who Gets Shit Done (Leia Organa from Star Wars/Wilma Deering from Buck Rogers?/All the Star Trek captains)
- Escaped lab subject (River Tam from Firefly/Takeshi Kovacs from Altered Carbon, kinda)
- Bruiser/Gun Nut (Jayne Cobb from Firefly/Worf from Star Trek)
- Droid/Android (R2D2, C3P0, BB8 from Star Wars/Data from Star Trek/Marvin from HHGTTG/Tweakie from Buck Rogers)
- Time-displaced Action Hero (Buck Rogers/Whatisname from Altered Carbon)
- Bio-engineered Super-soldier (Takeshi Kovacs)

Could the Enigmatic Alien and the Mysterious Hermit be rolled into 1? I suspect they'll both have very similar moves.

Could Mysterious Hermit and Disgraced Priest be rolled into one?  Book, the digraced priest, is pretty much the only example of the "Fallen" archetype that I can think of immediately.  Maybe also Leia Organa, as Royalty whose planet was destroyed? I guess there's some overlap between the Hermit and the Fallen, given Obi Wan Kenobi's example. He obviously fits The Hermit, but also as one of the last Jedi Knights, now in hiding, he fits The Fallen pretty well too I guess.   If the Hermit had a choice of backgrounds or reasons for being a hermit, one of them could be "Last of a secret order, driven underground by the Conglomerate."

Whilst Takeshi Kovacs is more Cyberpunk than hard scifi in book 1, book 2 is pure scifi. However, I suspect he can be rolled up into the escaped lab subject.  

Can Cocky Smuggler and Ace Pilot be rolled up into one?  "Ace Pilot" could simply be a move that several playbooks have.  So some moves would appear in multiple playbooks, unlike MotW or DW.  Having said that, I can see why those two games eschewed overlapping special moves. All that would happen is that players would coordinate to ensure that all core skills were covered, meaning that you'd be choosing your character moves by comittee, rather than by what you think would be cool.  

Bounty Hunter can Bruiser/Gun-Nut can be rolled into one quite easily.

Escaped Lab Subject/Bio-engineered-super-soldier could roll up with Time-displaced Action Hero, but the Time-Displaced might just as easily roll up with Ace Pilot, or Bruiser. If we lean away from existing film/TV characters, then the Time-displaced would make an interesting hermit.


All of the above reduces the list down to:

- Cocky smuggler/Ace pilot
- Science officer 
- Overworked engineer (Kaylee Frye from Firefly/Scotty from Star Trek)
- Bounty Hunter/Bruiser/Gun Nut
- Mysterious hermit/Enigmatic alien/Disgraced priest
- Noble/politician who Gets Shit Done (Leia Organa from Star Wars/Wilma Deering from Buck Rogers?/All the Star Trek captains)
- Escaped lab subject/Bio-engineered Super-soldier 
- Droid/Android (R2D2, C3P0, BB8 from Star Wars/Data from Star Trek/Marvin from HHGTTG/Tweakie from Buck Rogers)
- Time-displaced Action Hero

I'm still leaning back towards having archetypes with a choice of backgrounds, rather than lots of individual playbooks.  
E.g.  The Bruiser with backgrounds
- Bounty Hunter <It's just business. Nothing personal>
- Person from a byegone era, thawed out of cryo-storage. "We did things differently back then...<thwack!>"
- Bio-engineered Super-Soldier. "I don't know where all these bodies came from, but I blacked out for a second"


Given that I also want to be able to squeeze each playbook onto one sheet of A4 (or US Letter) I suspect I won't have room to do all the bits of a MotW playbook plus backgrounds that include a move each.  Maybe if I squish moves and backgrounds together, so each move says/implies something about the background of the character?  

What do I want in each playbook?  
With 3 columns in landscape orientation, I have 6 columns in total. 1/2 a column for some art maybe. 1/2 column for playbook title and blurb. So 5 columns.

- Name
- Pronouns
- Appearance
- Relationships = at least 1 column
- Moves = 2-3 columns
- Gear = 1 column
- Stats (including health?) = 1 column. Maybe 2, depending on how I implement harm.

I think the background+move idea could easily eat one of those columns. Maybe even 2. I'm already looking at 5-6 columns gone even without that.

So what might "move + background" look like?

- [ ] __Nothing Personal__. Your time as a bounty hunter has left you cold and dispassionate about the harm you inflict on others.  When you __Resort To Violence__ you may roll _+Cool_ rather than _+Tough_.
- [ ] __Amped Reflexes__. Bio-engineered soldiers like yourself can often react without having to think about it, but the adrenalin comedown always takes it's toll. When you __Resort To Violence__, you can roll with +1, +2 or +3. But the GM can apply an equivalent penalty to one of your future rolls for any move. You may not use this move again until the GM has applied that penalty.
- [ ] __The Old-Fashioned Way__. These new-fangled weapons are all very well but back in your day, before they thawed you out, you knew how to get the job done up close and personal. When you __Resort To Violence__ using a melee weapon, or unarmed, you may roll with +1.

So those might look a bit clunky, but they kind of work. But would they work better without the explicit background being mentioned?

- [ ] __Nothing Personal__. Something in your past has left you cold and dispassionate about inflicting harm on others.  When you __Resort To Violence__ you may roll _+Cool_ rather than _+Tough_.
- [ ] __Amped Reflexes__. Your bio-engineering means you can often react without having to think about it, but the adrenalin comedown always takes it's toll. When you __Resort To Violence__, you can roll with +1, +2 or +3. But the GM can apply an equivalent penalty (e.g -2 if you chose +2) to one of your future rolls for any move. You may not use this move again until the GM has applied that penalty.
- [ ] __The Old-Fashioned Way__. These new-fangled weapons are all very well but back in your day people knew how to get the job done up close and personal. When you __Resort To Violence__ using a melee weapon, or unarmed, you may roll with +1.


Simple World suggests that playbook moves should follow these templates:
- When you do something relating to [_specialty_], add +1.
- You have the ability to [_do some sort of active special power_]. It counts
as a basic move using _stat_.
- You have [_some special passive power that has a constant effect_].
- You have a [_thing_]. When applicable, it adds +1 to [_stat_] and [_stat_].
- When you do [_specialty_], mark XP.
- Add +1 to [_stat_].


Based on that, the __Amped Reflexes__ move above might look more like 
- [ ] __Amped Reflexes__. Your bio-engineering means you can often react without having to think about it. When you __Defy Danger__ to avoid a sudden hazard or suprise attack, roll with +1. _(Note, this might be a bit OP, as both Defy Danger and Resort to Violence are likely to be the most common rolls in an action-heavy game.)_


In order to build a "Jedi Knight" character, I can see that the player might wish to choose something like the Mysterious Hermit PLaybook but give them the __The Old-Fashioned Way__ move. Unless I simply create a playbook for the Jedi-Knight-ish character archetype, with moves relying on _Anomalous_ and then a smattering requiring _Cool_ or _Tough_, or maybe even _Charm_.

What to call the various playbooks? The Hard-bitten only really works for law-enforcement and military, but not all violent characters will have that background.
I guess at this point it's worth checking whether I really want to try providing playbooks for all possible TV/Movie Scifi archetypes? Or whether to just go back to the ones I initially thought of. I guess players will identify more naturally with archetypes that remind them of specific characters from the media.  
I guess this is where I have to decide whether I'm making a hard-scifi game like Traveller, or some kind of Space Opera kind of game more like Star Wars (i.e. Monster of the Week in Space, as I originally envisaged).  If I'm making Space Opera, then leaning on familiar archetypes makes more sense.  All of the MotW playbooks pull from existing TV shows or movie franchises, after all.


- Cocky smuggler/Ace pilot
- Science officer 
- Overworked engineer (Kaylee Frye from Firefly/Scotty from Star Trek)
- Bounty Hunter/Bruiser/Gun Nut
- Mysterious hermit/Enigmatic alien/Defrocked priest\*
- Noble/politician who Gets Shit Done (Leia Organa from Star Wars/Wilma Deering from Buck Rogers?/All the Star Trek captains)
- Escaped lab subject/Bio-engineered Super-soldier 
- Droid/Android (R2D2, C3P0, BB8 from Star Wars/Data from Star Trek/Marvin from HHGTTG/Tweakie from Buck Rogers)
- Time-displaced Action Hero

I'm tempted to roll the Defrocked Priest up into the Noble/Politician one, and make them "Disgraced/Displaced Noble/Policitian/Priest". This is much closer to the original playbook idea for "The Fallen". That also leaves "Mysterious Hermit/Enigmatic Alien" a bit cleaner, as they'll lean heavily on anomalies in a way that wouldn't fit a priest.

I might also move "Escaped Lab Subject" into the Mysterious playbook and the Bio-engineered Super Soldier into the Bruiser playbook.  That leaves it looking more like this;

- Cocky smuggler/Ace pilot
- Science officer 
- Overworked engineer
- Bounty Hunter/Gun Nut/Bio-engineered Super-soldier 
- Mysterious hermit/Enigmatic alien/Escaped lab subject
- Fallen royal/politician/clergy
- Droid/Android
- Time-displaced Action Hero

That still means I need to have some way for the Mysterious playbook to get a melee weapon move, if I want people to replicate a jedi. Not a showstopper but I'd need to reword the move a bit from the _Old-Fashioned Way_ mentioned above.  

Also, the droid/android could be a background within another playbook or two, rahter than playbook on its own.

What moves might they all have? (names only, don't worry about effects yet).

What about changing "Scientist" to "Academic"? It puts a little more distance between this and the "Engineer" playbook I think. Also allows characters such as a clueless researcher. But that's not a TV/movie trope, so should I cater for it?  Try and finish the playbooks I have already, dumbass!

## Idea: Pinch the "Advanced Moves" thing from Dungeon World.
It was the "Jedi deflecting blaster bolts" that gave me this idea.  
- Starting move could be to simply deflect them so you don't take any damage.  
- Advanced move means you do damage to your enemies if you succeed
- Very advanced move means you don't need to be armed with a melee weapon.
Give the advanced move an XP cost and the very advanced move a much higher XP cost. Maybe have _"Requires Advanced Move"_ for the very advancd move, or just let the higher cost be the gate.  

Seriously though, again: grind out the first version of this without advanced moves.  

Maybe one of the reasons I'm struggling with this is that the separation between the archetypes is wrong. Maybe it should be more along the lines of 
- Ship-focussed (Han?, Chewie, Wash, Scotty, Kaylee, Mr T!) _Flying and Engineering_
- Science (Spock, Bones, Beverly Crusher
- Gun (Mandalorian, Jayne Cobb, takeshi Kovacs)
- Weird (Spock, Maya, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, River Tam, Deanna Troi)
- Charisma (Leia, Mal, Face, Cpt Kirk, Cpt Picard, Deanna Troi, Lt Riker)

Hmmm. I'm still seeing some crossover between playbooks.  Maybe the answer is to have all the moves on one sheet, and say that, if you don't have that move ticked, you simply roll straight 2d6-2, with no stat bonus. That might make the character sheet huge though, and moves away from the MotW playbook idea which is quick to pick up and play wth.


## Post-Laser-Ritter
So, I bought Laser-Ritter and it's so close to what I want, but I don't like the custom system they've built it around. It has however made me realise that by trying to cater for every SciFi franchise, I'll either never finish writing this, or it won't do any of them very well. I should focus on one (star wars? Fireflay? Star Trek?) and base my first playbooks on that.  

And screw trying to make my system slightly different to MotW. I should just make "MotW In Space". Alien of the Week :)  

Once I have the first playbooks done, I can then add on others to encompass other franchises. So maybe start with Star Wars and then add "Scientist" or "Escaped Lab Subject".

Laser-Ritter has picked 4 playbooks:
- Freebooter (The Mandalorian, Poe Damaron? )
- Smuggler (Han Solo, Lando Calrissian)
- Mystic (Obi Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader etc.)
- Diplomat (Leia Organa)

It also has a separate "Magic" system for the Mystic, which I'm not comfortable with. The Mystic's powers could easily be dealt with using standard playbook moves IMHO.

I think there's also room for the Droid playbook. Or maybe make it a background, as there is a droid bounty hunter in the Mandalorian? (IG-11, played by Taika Waititi)

I think the Laser-ritter Freebooter is a bit broad for my taste, but who in the Star Wars franchise is covered by it?  The Mandalorian, certainly. Some of the other bounty hunters in various films/series (Cara Dune, Gina Carano's character in The Mandalorian, and the other bounty hunters in The Empire Strikes Back).  I can't actually think of any other archetypes that are covered by the Freebooter who aren't bounty hunters.  

The only other characters who aren't Luke, Leia, Han etc. are not armoured at all, so don't fit the Freebooter, and some of them aren't shady at all so wouldn't fit the scoundrel. E.g. Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), Finn, Poe.  

Ugh, I'm going around in circles. Now I'm thinking that either I base playbooks on characters from the SW franchise, or try to lump them together, as I did originally at the start of all this.  Bounty-Hunter is a decent playbook idea I guess, as is Smuggler, but what about all the other characters who don't fit those, and aren't Droids, Mystics or Diplomats?  

I could have "Pilot" to cover Rose, Poe and Finn, but then Han Solo (smuggler) is also a decent pilot, as is Chewbacca and probably even the Mandalorian.  
And what about having Rebel Agents such as those from Rogue One? they don't fit into any of the above, but have characteristics from the Smuggler and the Bounty-Hunter (Good with weapons, and sneaking, and probably piloting too.)  

How does MotW handle this? As far as I can tell, they have some playbooks which are obviously based on one character
- The Chosen = Buffy
- The Divine = Angel, presumably
- The Professional = Scully from the X-Files. Possibly Mulder too, but he's closer to...
- The Flake = Mulder from the X-Files
- The Spell Slinger = Harry Dresden.

So maybe I should do the same:
- Fallen Nobility = Leia
- Smuggler = Han/Chewie/Lando
- Ancient Order = Obi Wan/Luke/Darth Vader. What about Rey?
- Ex-Authority Trooper = Finn
- Resistance Pilot = Poe/Wedge/Porkins/Rose/Finn (Ex-Authority background)
- Bounty Hunter = The Mandolorian/Cara Dune/IG-11/Boba Fett
- Droid = BB8/R2D2/IG-11/K2-SO
- Ingenue = Rey/Luke
- Resistance Agent = Jyn Erso

Dec 27th 2020:   
I've realised my choice comes down to "Create my own setting" or "Leave it more or less setting-independent but base each playbook on a TV/Movie character".  

Not sure which I prefer. There's already a Star Wars PbtA game, which looks good, but more crunchy than I'm looking for. Less crunchy than Uncharted Worlds or Impulse Drive though, which is something I suppose.  I guess if I'm looking to copy Monster of the Week, then the second option is preferable/easier.  I suppose also that I don't need to mention "The Empire" or "Browncoats" or anything seting-specific. I could just refer to "The Authorities" (The Authority?) and "The War". 

Am I going to bother with Space Jam, on itch.io? The deadline for game submissions is Jan 25th. That could be do-able, but I don't much fancy a deadline. Also, the "No Fascists" bit is a thorny issue. Does that mean no Fascist empires to be overthrown?  And the "No Bigotry" clause is obviously a good thing, but it makes me wonder whether the "Newly sentient droid" playbook might fall foul of that. If the setting implies that droids are and have istorically been viewed as property, then under what circumstances is this one now sentient? Have they always been sentient, but still considered property? Strong echoes of slavery there, which is to be avoided like the plague. If they're generally not sentient, and this one is an exception, how will they be treated by a society that views the rest of them as property?  I suspect the Newly-Sentient Droid playbook might have to be nixxed.
