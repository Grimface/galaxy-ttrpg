So, for the character playbooks, should they be "Few broad themes, with background options" or "Each background option + theme as it's own playbook"?

I want playbooks to stand alone, a-la Monster Of The Week and Dungeon World. Not have a complicated Traveller-style character creation process like Uncharted Worlds or Impulse Drive.

What individual playbooks mght there be, if I were to cover off all possible popular TV/Movie characters?

- The cocky smuggler (Malcom Reynolds from Firefly/Han Solo from Star Wars)
- The science officer (Bones, Spock, Uhura from Star Trek)
- The grumpy engineer (Kaylee Frye from Firefly/Scotty from Star Trek)
- The bounty hunter (The Mandalorian, Boba Fett)
- The mysterious hermit (Obi Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in the later Star Wards films/The Vorlon ambassador from Babylon 5)
- The enigmatic alien (THe Vorlon ambassador, Delenn from Babylon 5/ Spock from Star Trek/ Yoda, Baby Yoda from Star Wars/)
- The disgraced priest (Book from Firefly)
- The ace pilot (Wash from Firefly/Luke or Han from Star Wars)
- The noble/politician who Gets Shit Done (Leia)
- The escaped lab subject (River Tam from Firefly)
