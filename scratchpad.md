So, for the character playbooks, should they be "Few broad themes, with background options" or "Each background option + theme as it's own playbook"?

I want playbooks to stand alone, a-la Monster Of The Week and Dungeon World. Not have a complicated Traveller-style character creation process like Uncharted Worlds or Impulse Drive.

What individual playbooks might there be, if I were to cover off all the popular TV/Movie characters I can think of?

- Cocky smuggler (Malcom Reynolds from Firefly/Han Solo from Star Wars)
- Science officer (Bones, Spock, Uhura, Beverly Crusher, Miles O'Brien from Star Trek/Professor Bergman from Space 1999)
- Overworked engineer (Kaylee Frye from Firefly/Scotty from Star Trek)
- Bounty hunter (The Mandalorian, Boba Fett)
- Mysterious hermit (Obi Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in the later Star Wars films/The Vorlon ambassador from Babylon 5)
- Enigmatic alien (Delenn from Babylon 5?/Spock, Deanna Troi, Odo from Star Trek/Yoda, Baby Yoda from Star Wars/Maya from Space 1999/Hawk from Buck Rogers)
- Disgraced priest (Book from Firefly)
- Ace pilot (Mal, Wash from Firefly/Luke or Han from Star Wars/Buck Rogers)
- Noble/politician who Gets Shit Done (Leia Organa from Star Wars/Wilma Deering from Buck Rogers?/All the Star Trek captains)
- Escaped lab subject (River Tam from Firefly/Takeshi Kovacs from Altered Carbon, kinda)
- Bruiser/Gun Nut (Jayne Cobb from Firefly/Worf from Star Trek)
- Droid/Android (R2D2, C3P0, BB8 from Star Wars/Data from Star Trek/Marvin from HHGTTG/Tweakie from Buck Rogers)
- Time-displaced Action Hero (Buck Rogers/Whatisname from Altered Carbon)
- Bio-engineered Super-soldier (Takeshi Kovacs)

Could the Enigmatic Alien and the Mysterious Hermit be rolled into 1? I suspect they'll both have very similar moves.

Could Mysterious Hermit and Disgraced Priest be rolled into one?  Book, the digraced priest, is pretty much the only example of the "Fallen" archetype that I can think of immediately.  Maybe also Leia Organa, as Royalty whose planet was destroyed? I guess there's some overlap between the Hermit and the Fallen, given Obi Wan Kenobi's example. He obviously fits The Hermit, but also as one of the last Jedi Knights, now in hiding, he fits The Fallen pretty well too I guess.   If the Hermit had a choice of backgrounds or reasons for being a hermit, one of them could be "Last of a secret order, driven underground by the Conglomerate."

Whilst Takeshi Kovacs is more Cyberpunk than hard scifi in book 1, book 2 is pure scifi. However, I suspect he can be rolled up into the escaped lab subject.  

Can Cocky Smuggler and Ace Pilot be rolled up into one?  "Ace Pilot" could simply be a move that several playbooks have.  So some moves would appear in multiple playbooks, unlike MotW or DW.  Having said that, I can see why those two games eschewed overlapping special moves. All that would happen is that players would coordinate to ensure that all core skills were covered, meaning that you'd be choosing your character moves by comittee, rather than by what you think would be cool.
