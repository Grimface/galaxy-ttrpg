### Pick A Background:
- [ ] Ruined Zillionaire Ex-CEO. You were a high-flying, cutthroat executive. You took it hard when it all collapsed and you lost everything.

- [ ] Disgraced Noble/Politician. You had the ear of every president, king, and civil servant for light years around, until the incident. Now your name is spoken only in whispers, as a horrible example.
